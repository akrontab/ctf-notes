# i^2 = -1 - Misc

## Description

after 4 years of college, I finally got to learn complex analysis. I also took PDE that semester ¯\(ツ)/¯

## Solution

Given two images of a car

Can we multiply them together using Image Magick?

https://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/compose/#multiply

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/img]
└─$ ./magick composite -compose Multiply -gravity center car1.png car2.png output.png
```

Nope

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/img]
└─$ stegosuite extract --key=car1.png car2.png 
Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true
Loading png image from /home/kali/Desktop/img/car2.png
Extracting data...
Error: Could not extract. Wrong key?
                                                                                                                           
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/img]
└─$ stegosuite extract --key=car2.png car1.png 
Picked up _JAVA_OPTIONS: -Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.aatext=true

Nope on stegosuite

Trying to xor the images together doesn't work either

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/img]
└─$ ./magick convert car1.png car2.png -fx "(((255*u)&(255*(1-v)))|((255*(1-u))&(255*v)))/255" output.png
```

### Hints

> What is common between those 2 subjects.

This hint might indicate finding the same pixel values between the two images.

> Try reading the chall description very fast...

"4 years" said fast almost sounds like Fourier. Maybe an FFT or some other Fourier analysis or transform would work

"Complex analysis" may indicate complex numbers
