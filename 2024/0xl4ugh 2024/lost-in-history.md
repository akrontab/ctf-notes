# Lost In History - OSINT

## Description

MM0X and xElessaway were in a mission to find someone but seems they had a stalker and got us this picture of them both. can you identify the place they were?

Flag Format: 0xL4ugh{The Name of the place with spaces}

## Solution

There's no Exif info on the photo so that lead is a dead end.

We can google the username xElessaway and find his instagram. There's a photo with a place that has similar walls and floors which is the `National Museum Of Egyptian Civilization`. So we plug that into the flag and get:

Flag: `0xL4ugh{National Museum Of Egyptian Civilization}`
